## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Sync embedding on POST — acceptable if Gemini text embedding stays under 2s; check server logs after first submission and switch to async if P95 > 3s
- [Pre-phase]: Similarity threshold set at 0.75 (research-derived, not empirically tuned) — log similarity scores on every retrieval call for first month
- [Pre-phase]: Hard cap of 5 injected feedback entries per generation — prevents context bloat
- [Pre-phase]: ON DELETE SET NULL on FK — defensive; project deletion feature does not currently exist

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Pitfall — wrong vector table. feedback-vector-store.ts must never call addVector()/searchSimilarVectors() from vector-store.ts; they are hardcoded to reference_images
- Phase 4: Partial wiring is a silent trust failure — all 4 generation routes must be wired simultaneously, not one-at-a-time
